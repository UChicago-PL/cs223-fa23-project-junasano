# Fractal Generator in Haskell:

## Starting out:

In order to run this project, I have created a .cabal file with the necessary build dependencies. To make sure this project runs on your computer, make sure to run:

`cabal update`
`cabal install --dependencies-only`
`cabal build`

You should then be ready to go with running the project. Keep in mind I have placed the haskell files in a folder called "app".

When you want to run Main.hs in order to get an output (like a still image or animation), please run `cabal run` on your terminal. This will start the fractal generator program and follow the prompts displayed to use the generator!
